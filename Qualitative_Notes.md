# Qualitative Data Themes:

### Interest Selection:

- Rare errors for participants
- Easy for participants to understand to click button on page when given task
- Appear to dislike List layout, some participants did not understand why tasks were not categorized

### Chat Functionality:

- Random Chat Button is misleading for users. Accidental messaging.
- Visible confusion since Enter Button does not work in chat
- Users often confused on how to message friends on Version B

### Friend List:

- Users would find the mood through trial and error clicking
- Missing links to chat and profile pages would lead users to dead end
- Overlap with chat functionality
- Page serves purpose only as mood
- Some tasks would finish very quickly due to (accidentally) using the friends list for the previous task
- User suggestion: Have mood as default profile picture

### Overall System Task:

- Few errors, but users were more creative on how to complete task.
- Appeared to be usable. For a real website, we should include more information about the user

### Questionairre:

Q1: What page do you think is easiest to determine a friendâ€™s interest?

- Friends List, unless you want to dive deeper with somebody, then chat.

Q2: Do you think having more buttons on the front page is better?

- Very clear NO. A critique with the buttons is that the buttons should be able to navigate the user to all site functionality

Q3: Were you confused about the purpose of any specific page on our website?

- No, but some users found the friends list page to be missing functionality and navigation to other pages.

Q4: Did anything feel missing from the application?

- Some additional functionality like additional profile features (mutual friends, bio, profile picture), friends list navigation to chat & profile, group chats. Organization of interests
